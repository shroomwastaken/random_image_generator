# random_image_generator
makes random images with 16 bit color depth

usage: `./rand_img_gen.exe [width] [height] [output path]`

example `./rand_img_gen.exe 600 600 "./output.bmp"`

result:

![](./output.png)

file format should be bmp otherwise the image is not going to open (there's a .png in this repo because github doesnt want to display bmp images for some reason)
